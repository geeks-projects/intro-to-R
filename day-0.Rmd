It's good to have you join our class. We are excited that you are taking this bold step to start your journey to learn R! Let's get started!

## Getting started

### How to install R and RStudio

To get yourself ready to start a journey learning r programming, you need to get a computer system that has R installed on it and an IDE that makes learning easy and fun like RStudio. You can get this done by following this steps in order:

1.  Install R Download R for Mac by opening this link [mac](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/) or this link for [windows](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/). The links would open a web page showing you how to download the appropriate files right for your computer's operating system. Install R by double-clicking the downloaded and follow ths simple promts and default selected options to complete your installation. When you are done with this installation, follow the next step below.

2.  Install RStudio IDE Click this link [rstudio IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) to download the installation file. Scroll down the web page to click the button for the **RStudio FREE download** option. <br>

## Install and load packages in R

### What is a package?


```{r}

# installing a single package with base R
# install.packages("pacman")

# installing multiple packages with base R
# install.packages(c("tidyverse", "xlsx", "lubridate", "skimr", "janitor", "rmarkdown", "rio", "here"))
```

<br>

```{r}
# Installing (if necessary) and load packages using pacman package
# pacman::p_load(tidyverse, lubridate, xlsx, skimr, janitor, rmarkdown, rio, here)
```

<br>

You are ready to begin writing your first code!
