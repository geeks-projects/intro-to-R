## Install and load packages in R

### What is a package?

```{r}

# installing a single package with base R
# install.packages("pacman")

# installing multiple packages with base R
# install.packages(c("tidyverse", "lubridate", "xlsx", "skimr", "janitor", "rmarkdown", "rio", "here"))
```

```{r}
# Installing (if necessary) and load packages using pacman package
# pacman::p_load(tidyverse, lubridate, skimr, xlsx, janitor, rmarkdown, rio, here)
# library(tidyverse)
# library(lubridate)
```

## Why R?

### Brief definition 
- R is a programming language. 
- free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. 
- Used to perform interesting tasks such as linear regression, logistic regression, time series, statistical inference, and much more. 
- used for creating data visuals, reports, geographical analysis and web applications.

### R is used for:

Statistical inference
Data analysis
Machine learning
Executing scientific simulations
Operations research

## Data Types and Structures in R

### Understanding Data Types

The best and right way to start your journey learning R programming language is to have a solid understanding of data types and structures and when to use them.

To begin, **remember that in R, everything is an object**.

Next, we are looking at **some** of the basic data types in R.

a.  character - symbols, letters, words or phrases in single or double quotation marks

    <br>

```{r}
"bread"

'coffee'

"12"

"I need 2 cups of coffee."
class("12") 
typeof("12") 

```

b.  numeric

```{r}
1

123

12.3

class(12.3) 
typeof(123) 
```

c.  integer - a special case of numeric data, discrete values like unique identifiers eg. student id. To store a value as an integer, we need to specify it as such. Integers are usually followed by the capital 'L' notation to denote the data type.

```{r}
12

100

10L

class(100) 
typeof(10L) 
```

d.  logical - logical or boolean values i.e. TRUE or FALSE.

```{r}
FALSE

hasPVC <- TRUE
hasPVC
```



<br>

The elements of each of these data types can be combined to form data structures, such as data frames, atomic vectors, etc.

## Understanding Data structures

Data structures - a means of organizing data for effective use. 
This helps to reduce the challenges faced in managing space and performance of our codes.

As with other programming languages, in R programming language, different variables are used to store different data which are stored in reserved area in the system memory.

<br>

In this section, we will be covering the **some** of the data structures in R:

<br>

1.  Vectors

<br>

```{r}
# vectors
c()

my_vector <- c("bags", "shoes", "wrist-watch", "money")

my_vector

my_alphabets <- letters[1:10]

my_alphabets


```

2.  Lists

```{r}
# lists
# List
# list is a generic vector containing different types of objects.

# For example, the following variable x is a list containing copies of three vectors n, s, b, and a numeric value 3.

a = c(2, 3, 5) 
b = c("aa", "bb", "cc", "dd", "ee") 
c = c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE) 
my_list = list(a, b, c, 3, "My name")   # my_list contains copies of a,b,c,3
# List Slicing
# We retrieve a list slice with the single square bracket "[]" operator. 
# The following is a slice containing the second member of my_list, which is a copy of b.

my_list[2] 

# With an index vector, we can retrieve a slice with multiple members. 
# Here a slice containing the second and fourth members of my_list.

my_list[c(2, 4)] 

# Member Reference
# In order to reference a list member directly, we have to use the double square bracket "[[]]" operator. 
# The following object my_list[[2]] is the second member of my_list. 
# In other words, my_list[[2]] is a copy of b, but is not a slice containing b or its copy.

my_list[[2]] 

# We can modify its content directly.

my_list[[2]][2] = "ta" 
my_list[[2]] 


# Named List Members
# We can assign names to list members, and reference them by names instead of numeric indexes.
# 
# For example, in the following, v is a list of two members, named "bob" and "john".

v = list(bob=c(2, 3, 5), john=c("aa", "bb")) 
v # print

# List Slicing
# We retrieve a list slice with the single square bracket "[]" operator. Here is a list slice containing a member of v named "bob".

v["bob"] 
v[1]
v$bob

# With an index vector, we can retrieve a slice with multiple members. Here is a list slice with both members of v. Notice how they are reversed from their original positions in v.

v[c("john", "bob")] 

# Member Reference
# In order to reference a list member directly, we have to use the double square bracket "[[]]" operator. 
# The following references a member of v by name.

v[["bob"]] 

# A named list member can also be referenced directly with the "$" operator in lieu of the double square bracket operator.

v$bob 

```

3.  Data Frames

- Create a data frame
```{r}
library(tidyverse)

# Create a data frame
my_df_no_colnames <- data.frame(
  c("John", "Buba"),
  c(2,3)
)
```

- Assign col names

```{r}
# assign col names
names(my_df_no_colnames) <- c("Student Name", "Gender")

# Print my_df to the screen
my_df_no_colnames

# View the class of my_df
class(my_df_no_colnames)

```

- Create data frame from a vector

```{r}

# Vectors
student_names <- c("Michael", "Bello", "Tonye", "Tayo","Yusuf", "Success", "Aisha")
gender <- c("M","M","F","F","M","M", "F")

# Data frame
# create a data frame from vectors
my_df <- data.frame(student_names,gender)

# my_df <- data_frame(student_names,gender) `data_frame()` was deprecated in tibble 1.1.0

```

4. Tibble

- Create a tibble
```{r}
# Tibble
# Create a tibble
tibble(1:5, c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e"))

# Check this out! What went wrong?
#tibble(1:5, c("a","d","e")) 
```

- Create tibble with named columns
```{r}
name = c("john", "alexis", "Steph", "Quiera")
age  = c(24, 44, 26, 25)

my_tbl <- tibble(
  name = c("jojo", "sofia", "robin", "sisie"),
  age  = c(14, 13, 16, 15)
)

my_tbl <- tibble(name,age)


# Print my_df to the screen
my_tbl

```

- More on tibbles

```{r}
# Add new column
# Example 1: Add Column with $-Operator
state_residence <- c("Abia","Ogun", "Kwara", "Bayelsa")
state_of_origin <- c("Adamawa","Oyo", "Kwara", "Borno")

my_tbl$state_residence <- state_residence                    # Add new column to data

my_tbl["state of origin"] <- c("Adamawa","Oyo", "Kwara", "Borno")                    # Add new column to data

my_tbl$dob <- c("23-09-1900", "09-09-2001", "23-09-2009", "")

# Not assigned to the tibble, my_tbl
my_tbl %>% add_column(student_color = c("red", "yellow", "green", "black"), student_weight = c(5:8))

# Assigned to the tibble, my_tbl
my_tbl <- my_tbl %>% add_column(student_color = c("red", "yellow", "green", "black"), student_weight = c(5:8))


# Add new rows or observation
new_row <- c("Tayo", 12, "Borno", "Borno", NA, "purple", 6.7)
my_tbl <- rbind(my_tbl, new_row)              # Apply rbind function

fruits <- c("Apple", "orange","fig","banana","Apple")

# rows and columns
my_tbl <- bind_cols(my_tbl, fruits)
bind_rows()

```

- Difference between data frame and tibble

```{r}
# Difference between data frame and tibble
# Create a data frame using the data.frame() function

# check out this! What is the problem?
# my_df <- data.frame(
#   name       = c("john", "alexis", "Steph", "Quiera"),
#   age_years  = c(24, 44, 26, 25),
#   age_months = age_years * 12
# )

# fix it up
# my_df <- data.frame(
#   name       = c("john", "alexis", "Steph", "Quiera"),
#   age_years  = c(24, 44, 26, 25)
# )

# my_df$age_months <-  my_df$age_years * 12
 
# tibble
my_tbl <- tibble(
  name       = c("john", "alexis", "Steph", "Quiera"),
  age_years  = c(24, 44, 26, 25),
  age_months = age_years * 12
)

```

## Control statements

- enable control the flow of execution of a series of R expressions
```{r}
# refer to script on control statements
```

## Functions in R

### Why functions?

-   automate common tasks

-   named function making codes esier to understand.

-   update code easily when requirements or tasks are changed.

-   eliminate copy and paste of same codes in multiple places in a single script


```{r}
# refer to script on functions
```
